# Conversation Summary

## Context

### 1. Previous Conversation
The user requested a progressive tutorial for learning JUCE audio app/plugin development, starting from a minimal JUCE app that only opens a window. They wanted to learn GUI development for audio apps, how to create both plugins and standalone apps (including AUv3 for iPad/macOS), and audio programming fundamentals. The user is familiar with C++11 but needed introduction to modern C++ concepts.

### 2. Current Work
I successfully created a comprehensive 7-module JUCE tutorial series that transforms a basic "Hullo JUCE!" window application into a professional-grade audio plugin with advanced features. The tutorial progresses from basic GUI concepts through advanced audio processing and modern C++ techniques, culminating in a complete documentation system with examples and learning paths.

### 3. Key Technical Concepts
- **JUCE Framework**: Component hierarchy, AudioProcessor interface, plugin architecture, multi-target builds
- **Audio Programming**: Real-time audio processing, DSP algorithms (EQ, compression, delay), spectrum analysis, MIDI integration
- **Modern C++**: C++11 through C++20 features including auto, lambdas, smart pointers, concepts, template metaprogramming, coroutines
- **Plugin Development**: VST3, AU, AUv3 formats, parameter management, host integration, cross-platform deployment
- **GUI Development**: Component lifecycle, event handling, layout management, custom styling, touch interfaces
- **Build Systems**: CMake configuration, multi-platform builds, code signing, automated deployment
